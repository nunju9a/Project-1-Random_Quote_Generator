# A Random Quote Generator - Received grade of "Exceeds Expectations"

This project practiced my knowledge of basic JavaScript syntax and data structures by building a Random Quote Generator - a program that displays a randomly selected quote each time the user clicks a button. The page automatically refreshes every 10 seconds, and also displays a random background color with each quote. The quotes have a Star Wars theme - May the force be with you!
