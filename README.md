# A Random Quote Generator 
- Received grade of "Exceeds Expectations"

This project practiced my knowledge of basic JavaScript syntax and data structures by building a Random Quote Generator - a program that displays a randomly selected quote each time the user clicks a button. The page automatically refreshes every 10 seconds, while also displaying a random background color with each quote. Conditional statements are used to check if there are citation, year, and tag properties, then display them if they exist. The quotes have a Star Wars theme - May the force be with you!
